# My name is myBot! 
## The bot that will help you create knowledge
## from documents you provide so that others
## can ask me questions and receive your knowledge ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Hi there,  
ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to have you on board. 
I will help you learn all about "the topic".
Ask me questions and I'll try to answer them as best I can.

I am built on top of LLMs (OpenAI's GPT-4), 
LLM Orchestration Frameworks (Llama-Index),  
Vector Database (Pinecone.ai), and
Chat UI Framework (Chainlit).

Note: myBot is currently set up to discuss large language models based on some very simple markdown formatted documents that I had ChatGPT write for me. If you run this you would need to change the documents and the topic to something that you want to discuss. And then you would need to run markdown_embeddings.py to create the embeddings for the documents.
